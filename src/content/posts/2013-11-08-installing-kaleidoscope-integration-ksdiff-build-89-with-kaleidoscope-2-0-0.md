<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The other day I was using the fantastic file diff application <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a>, and I wanted to integrate the diff functionality with my SVN client. Kaleidoscope provides a terminal tool called KSdiff that integrates the GUI Kaleidoscope application with other programs.</p>
<p>However, after installing KSdiff from the Kaleidoscope website as directed, KSdiff build 111 told me that my version of Kaleidoscope was too low and that I needed to upgrade my application to use Kaleidoscope's integration features. In other words, the version of KSdiff I had installed was too high for my current installation of the application.</p>
<p>I didn't want to upgrade Kaleidoscope right away, so I Googled around for an older version of KSdiff that would work with my out-of-date Kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mplewis.com/files/ksdiff-89.zip">ksdiff-89.zip</a> on the Kaleidoscope CDN. That file did what I was looking for!</p>
<p>If you're having the same problem I am and want to integrate Kaleidoscope without upgrading from version 2.0.0, <a href="http://www.mplewis.com/files/ksdiff-89.zip">download and install ksdiff-89.zip</a> and you'll have integration with Kaleidoscope in your favorite version control clients.</p>
