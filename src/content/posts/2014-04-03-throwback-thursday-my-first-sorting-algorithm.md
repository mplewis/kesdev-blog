<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I just rediscovered some code I wrote for the University of Minnesota's <em>&quot;Structure of Computer Programming I&quot;</em>, a course I took three years ago. CSCI 1901 focused mostly on learning Scheme with everyone's favorite Scheme textbook, the venerable <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP from MIT</a>.</p>
<p>To get better at writing Scheme, I practiced by writing two versions of the bubble sort algorithm. One sorted a list of integers into increasing order, while another sorted a list of Cartesian tuples (x, y coordinates) into increasing distance from the origin. I think these sorts are even stable!</p>
<p>Building a bubblesort algorithm from scratch is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done as a programmer. To this day I'm still proud of these programs.</p>
<p>I even commented (one of) them. Enjoy:</p>
